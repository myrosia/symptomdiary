This is a python app written to support diary keeping for chronic pain,
possibly other conditions. It is based on common information doctors recommend
tracking. The set of questions, and corresponding DB structure, may evolved as
project changes.

The project uses Kivy library and sqlite, which must be installed separately. 

To run, execute "python main.py". By default it uses data/entries.db file in
the script directory, but you can pass an alternative DB file path on the
command line.
